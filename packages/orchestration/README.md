## Structure

The _Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM)_ objects are generated by utilizing [Kustomize](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/). A `kustomization.yml` file describes how to generate or transform other _KRM_ objects.

Additional abstractions for environments can be made by utilizing _Kustomization_ ["overlays"](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/examples/multibases/multi-namespace.md). This project makes use of two overlays reflecting the environments _development_ and _production_.
